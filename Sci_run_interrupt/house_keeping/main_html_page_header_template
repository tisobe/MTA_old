Radiation Count Rate Plots for Periods Which Interrupted Science Runs

The following plots are:
<ul>
<li>HRC Shield rate : after Year 2014</li>
<li>E150 electron count rate (electron Counts/cm2 sed sr eV ) between Year 2006 and Year 2014</li>
<li>P41 proton count rate  (15.0 -  40.0 MeV protons Counts/cm2 sec sr MeV) before Year 2006</li>
</ul>
around science runs were interrupted.  Plots start exactly 2 days before the interruption
started, and fnish 5 days after. ACE radiation data and other proton/electron count rate data
for the same periods can be found by clicking one of the plots, which opens up the page for
the specific period.

<p style="font-weight:boldpadding-left:4empadding-right:6em">
If a plot is noted with "auto", the science run was automatically interrupted because the high radiation
tripped one of the criteria. If it is noted with "manual", it was done by an operator's judgement.

Note: Data points in 2000 Data are one hour average. All others are 5 min average.
Plots after 2011 are siginficatlly different. Montoring of P4 and P41 were discontinued and 
replaced by e150 and e1500. GOES data are also chnaged from that of GOES 11 to GOES 15.
