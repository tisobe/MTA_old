these scripts are used to recover the data. just give <msid_list> 
in the <house_keeping> direcotry. the recovered fits data files will
be deposited in ./Outdir/.

rerun_long_ver2.py ---- use this when rerun_long.py fails. it seems
                        the failure happens due to the largeness of
                        the data set downloaded. 
                        the speed is far slower than rerun_long.py
                        and hece use of rerun_long.py is preferable.
