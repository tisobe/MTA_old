<h2>MTA CTI Trending (Revised: Sept 2010)</h2>

<p>
MTA group is monitoring
AICS charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) continuously from the beginning 
of the mission.  In this memo, we summarize what we see on 
<a href='http://asc.harvard.edu/mta_days/mta_cti/cti_page.html'>MTA CTI page</a>.

<p>
CTI of front side CCDs are very sensitive to a CCD focal plane temperature and a particle background. 
However, these effects are easily removed.

Removing the CTI/Background Anti-Correlation</a> by Grant,

and

 Does The CTI Correction Factor Changes With Time?</a> for related topics
).

After removing these effects, the trend of the CTI  degradation is a very smooth linear increase.


The back side CCDs are, on the other hand, not sensitive to these two factors, and the changes
of CTIs are also smaller compared to those of the front side CCDs.
For the last 5 years, the rate of CTI change is very steady and gradual of
~ a few  10e-6 CTI/yr. Even the Oct 2003 CME did not affect the rate of the change (See
<a href='http://space.mit.edu/~cgrant/cti/change/change.html'>
Did ACIS CTI change after the Oct 2003 CME?</a> by Grant).


<p>
The following table and the plots  show CTI trends after corrected temperature dependence of CTI, and 
particle background (Mn K-alpha). For comparison, CTIs with long exposure ( >7000 sec) and a focal 
plane temperature lower than or equal to  -119.7 C are also plotted (both of them are particle
background corrected, except for backside CTI). For I-array CTI computation, CCDs i-0, i-1, i-2, and i-3 are
included.  For S-array CTI, only s-0, s-2, s-3, and s-4 (front side CCDs) are included.

<p>
Since the temperature corrections uses the long exposure data 
to estimate correction factors, the similarity of the slope values between these two
data sets is expected. Since the error of the slopes are about 0.07e-06 for all, 
the slopes computed on these two data sets are basically identical.

<p>
Note: unit is CTI/yr, and errors are around 0.07e-06 for all the slopes.
The values are those of Sep 21, 2010.

<p>
Occasional outliers on the plots below are due to CTI computational problems, not a real physical effect. 
For example, a point on <i>Day of Mission</i> (DOM) = 1154.7 (09/18/2002) has one anomalous CTI
reading from CCD 0 node 2 (4.182), probably due to  missed line fitting on the peak of the Mn K-alpha. 
All other nodes are normal for this data. Most outliers have shorter integrations time, which
makes finding a peak more difficult.

<p>
The following table shows CTI change per year and average CTI of December 2005 and September 2010 of quad 0 of each CCD 
(based on Mn K-alpha). 
Except CCDs 5 and 7, all CTIs are corrected for the focal temperature and particle background.
The CTI and the  rate of the change are much smaller for the back side CCDs, and among the front side CCDs,
CCD 4 has much higher CTI and the higher CTI change rates.
