<h3>HRC PHA Evolution (QE and Gain Variation with Time)</h3>

<p style="text-align:left;">
Following <em>Posson-Brown</em> and <em>Donnelly's</em> memo (
<a href="./Trend_plots/hrc_gain.pdf" target='blank'>"Evolution of PHA Response in the HRC (pdf)"</a>),
we computed evolution of HRC PHA response using following steps:
</p>

<ul style="padding-left:70px;padding-right:120px;font-size:95%;text-align:justify;">
    <li> 
        Find calibration AR Lac observations with HRC. Event 2 data are used.
    </li>
    <li> 
        Compute a radial distance by taking difference between a pointing direction and AR Lac position
        (RA  = 332.179975 degree, DEC = 45.7422544 degree).
    </li>
    <li> 
        Find AR Lac by scanning the entire HRC.
    </li>
    <li> 
        Extract an area around AR Lac with the radius of 60 pixels if the distance less than 10 arcmin,
        200 pixels if the distance more than 10 arcmin.
    </li>
    <li> 
        A PHA distribution was obtained from this area, and fit a Vogit profile to find a peak position
        and a FWHM of the Voigt profile. A median is also computed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fit lines between year 2000 and 2012, and 2012 to current year. We dropped year 1999 data
        as they skew the distribution. 
    </li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:left;">
The plots below show the time trend plots of  PHA median, PHA Voigt peak position, and PHA FWHM.
The data points are separated into the radial distance from the aiming point less than 
5 arcmins (blue square), between 5 arcmins and 10 arcmins (red diamond), 
between 10 arcmins and 15 arcmins (green circle), and more than 15 arcmins (blue triangle).
Time positions are slightly shifted to right and left so that data points are not 
overlapped on the plot.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
The tables following the time trend plots list links to the plot of radial distributions 
of observations of each year.  Please select a year. It will open up a plot.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
<b>Note:</b> The following plots are interactive plots. If you hover the mouse on a data point, 
it will display the information about that data point. Because of the large size of the data, 
the page may take a while to load.
