<h3 style='padding-bottom:20px;color:#99FFFF'>A bad pixel was selected as follows:</h3>

<ul style="font:yellow;font-size:90%">
<li> acis*bias0.fits in a given period were obtained.</li>
<li> Compute an average of ADU for each CCD.</li>
<li> Compare the value of each pixel to the CCD average, if a pixel value
was 5 sigma higher than the average, a local average (32x32) was computed.</li>
<li>If the pixel value was still 5 sigma higher than the local average,
it was marked as a possible candidate for a warm pixel.</li>
<li> If a "warm" pixel candidate  shows up <b style='color:#FFCC33'>more than 70%</b> of the time in the last two weeks, 
the pixel is listed as <b style='color:#FFCC33'>a warm pixel</b>.</li>
<li> If a "warm" pixel candidate shows up <b style='color:#FFCC33'>more than 30% but less than 70%</b> of the time in the last two weeks,
the pixel is listed as <b style='color:#FFCC33'>a flickering pixel</b>.</li>
<li> If the pixels which appeared in "current warm pixels" list, even once in the past
 the pixels are parmanently listed in "Past Warm Pixels" list.</li>
<li> Hot pixels are defined as warm pixels with an adu value of greater than
 the CCD average +1000.</li>
<li> If the pixel was located at the edge of the CCD (y = 1023, 1024), it is ignored and not
 included on either the list.</li>
<li>For a hot pixel, a process was same, except a threshold was 
a ccd  average plus 1000 counts.</li>
</ul>



<h3 style='padding-bottom:20px;;color:#99FFFF'>A bad column was selected as follows:</h3>

<ul style="font:yellow;font-size:90%"><li> each column was averaged out, and compared to an average for an entire ccd.</li>
<li> If the average of the column was 5 sigma  higher than the average of the ccd
compare the column average to a local average (10 columns).</li>
<li> If the column was still 5 sigma higher than the local average, mark it as
a bad column candidate.</li>
<li> If a "warm" column candidate  shows up more than 70% of the time in the last two weeks, it is listed as a warm columns.</li>
<li> If a "warm" column candidate shows up more than 30% but less than 70% of the time in the last two weeks, it is listed as a flickering columns.</li>
