acis_hist_main.perl
--------------------
This script does:
1. reads a date in month list (format:YYYY:MM)
2. obtains data from archive
3. reads a sim position from comprehensive_data_summary 
   and find where ACIS was located (at HRC-S or HRC-I)
4. finds out ACIS read out parameters, such as FEP, PBLOCK, EXPCOUNT
   so that we know which rows were exposed, and how long.
5. if ACIS was at an external source postion, 
	find out Al K alpha, Mn K alpha, and Ti K aplha peaks, 
	by fitting a gaussian profile. The quantities obtained were
	peak positions (ADU), peak widths (FWHM, ADU), and count
	rates (counts/sec).
6. if ACIS was at a background postion,
	keeps record of count rate (counts/sec) fro the entire range.
	for the later use.
	finds out count rates per 500 bins

Input:
	.hakama:			a password file	(/data/mta4/MTA/bin)
	.dare:				a user name file (/data/mta4/MTA/bin)
	month_list:			a list of a month (YYYY:MM)
	comprehensive_data_summary: 	a list of sim status, read sim location
					/data/mta_www/mta_temp/mta_states/MJ/$year/
	acisf*_hist0.fits:		acis histgram data from archive

Output:
	all outputs are saved in /data/mta/Script/ACIS/Acis_hist/Data/Data_<year>_<month>/CCD<ccd#> directory
		info_file:		name of all hist file processed, and
					sim postion (source or background), 
					and row read (low: 21-221, or high: 801-1001)
		acisf*_hist0: 		row count rateoutput data of the observation
		acisf*_hist0.gif:	a gif plot file of above
		node<node#>_low:	accumulated data for the node # at low (at source)
		node<node#>_low.gif:	a gif plot file of above
		node<node#>_high:	accumulated data for the node # at high (at source)
		node<node#>_high.gif:	a gif plot file of above
		node<node#>_low_bkg:	accumulated background data for node# at low
		node<node#>_low_bkg.gif:a gif plot file of above
		node<node#>_high_bkg:	accumulated background data for node# at high
		node<node#>_high_bkg.gif:a gif plot file of above
	note: bkg data are often missing due to rareity of HRC-I observations

PBLOCK: if 2342932: TE_0023C and reads out rows between 21 and 201
			http:/acis/mit/edu/cgi-bin/get-atbls?tag=TE_0023C
	if 2334740: TE_0023A and reads out rows between 801 and 1001 
			http:/acis/mit/edu/cgi-bin/get-atbls?tag=TE_0023A

-------------------------
acis_hist_plot_trend.perl
-------------------------
This script does:
1.  obtains peak postions, peak widths, and peak counts for three peaks from the
    acis_hist.perl output, and plot their trends along time (DOM).
    this is for acis is looking at the external source.

Input: 
	/data/mta/www/mta_acis_hist/Data/Results/CCD<ccd#>/node<node#>_<loc>: data file from acis_hist.perl. loc is high or low

Output:
	/data/mta/www/mta_acis_hist/Results/CCD<ccd#>/<loc>_peak.gif
	/data/mta/www/mta_acis_hist/Results/CCD<ccd#>/<loc>_width.gif
	/data/mta/www/mta_acis_hist/Results/CCD<ccd#>/<loc>_count.gif

---------------------------------
acis_hist_acc_bkg_plot_full.perl
---------------------------------
This script does:
1. obtains all backgound count rate data.
2. adds them up for each bin
3. re-bins to 40 bins to 1 bin, so that there are 100 bins instead 4000 for the entire range
4. plots the backgound.

Input:
	/data/mta/www/mta_acis_hist/Data/Results/CCD<ccd#>/node<node#>_<loc>_bkg:  background count rate data, loc: high or low

Output:
	/data/mta/www/mta_acis_hist/Data/Results/CCD<ccd#>/total_bkg.gif:               plot of above
	note: many background data are missing due to rarelity of HRC-I observations

Here's a table showing the various PBLOCKs (and window blocks) we've used
since the end of OAC.

------------------------------------------------

where N is the number of runs using this PBLOCK (shown above in decimal
and hexadecimal), WBLOCK is the value of its accompanying window block
(if used). NC indicates how many CCDs were run and whether they were
mostly from the I- or S-array. ROW1 indicates the first row read out,
and ROWS the total number of rows read.

The most common window blocks, 0x00038014 and 0x00039014, restrict the
rows to 801-1001 and 21-221, counting from 0, respectively. Without a
window block, all rows are accepted, i.e., 1-1022 (since an event
cannot be centered on row 0 or row 1023).

Most of our recent histogram runs have used 0x0023a014, 0x0023c014,
and 0x00452014, but we have also begun to use 0x006c2014 to monitor all
rows of the four ACIS-I chips + CCD_S3.
